# Tensorflow Demo
This repository contains an introduction in machine learning using Tensorflow.
Sample programs are provided as Jupyter Notebooks. Presentation slides can be
found [here](https://github.com/rzbrk/ml-demo/raw/x86-64/ml-demo.pdf)

## Launch Jupyter Notebooks
This requires that the Python virtual environment is already set up. If not,
follow the installation instructions below.

From within the repository directory execute:
```
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

## Installation
Detailled installation instructions are established in dedicated branches of
this repository:
* [x86-64 systems](https://github.com/rzbrk/ml-demo/tree/x86-64)
* [Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS](https://github.com/rzbrk/ml-demo/tree/rpios)
* [Raspberry Pi running DietPi OS](https://github.com/rzbrk/ml-demo/tree/dietpi)

### Aknowledgements
The Jupyter Notebooks are based on https://github.com/lmoroney/mlday-tokyo and
the tutorials on the [Tensorflow
website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).
The installation manual is based on https://github.com/PINTO0309/Tensorflow-bin.
